Ethereum Master Node Infrastructure

The key network resource of Ethereum mainnet -- known as "Master Node" -- has been kept secret since genesis, and widely misunderstood. However, with [EIP-3455](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3455) gaining traction it becomes necessary and helpful to begin to release information about this infrastructure.
